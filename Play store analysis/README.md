# Play store analysis project
Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature where in certain apps that are promising are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways – higher priority in recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). These will also get a boost in visibility in search results. This feature will help bring more attention to newer apps that have potential.Analyze the data and present your insights in a format consumable by business – the final output of the analysis would be presented to business as insights with supporting data/visualizations.

The goal of python project is to study data and turn it into meaningful information that will help in future for taking better decisions.<br/>

Steps I followed for basic Data Exploration and Preprocessing:<br/>
1.Identification of variables and data types<br/>
2.Analyzing the basic metrics<br/>
3.Variable transformations<br/>
4.Missing value treatment<br/>
5.Outlier treatment<br/>
6.Correlation Analysis<br/>

I have used eda to identify patterns from the data set<br/>
Those patterns provide insights into relationships between variables that can be used to improve business decisions
