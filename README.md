# Python_Projects
The goal of python is to study data and turn it into meaningful information that will help in future for taking better decisions.

Steps I followed for basic Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
1.Identification of variables and data types
2.Analyzing the basic metrics
3.Variable transformations
4.Missing value treatment
5.Outlier treatment
6.Correlation Analysis

I have used eda to identify patterns from the data set
Those patterns provide insights into relationships between variables that can be used to improve business decisions
