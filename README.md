# Python_Projects
The goal of python project is to study data and turn it into meaningful information that will help in future for taking better decisions.<br/>

Steps I followed for basic Data Exploration and Preprocessing:<br/>
1.Identification of variables and data types<br/>
2.Analyzing the basic metrics<br/>
3.Variable transformations<br/>
4.Missing value treatment<br/>
5.Outlier treatment<br/>
6.Correlation Analysis<br/>

I have used eda to identify patterns from the data set<br/>
Those patterns provide insights into relationships between variables that can be used to improve business decisions
